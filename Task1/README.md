Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diabetes Dataset Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a publicly available Diabetes dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, perform basic statistical analysis, and visualize key patterns using charts and graphs. Dataset

* Source: Kaggle (Diabetes dataset, [link to dataset])
* The dataset contains information related to diabetes  patients, including features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more. The target variable indicates whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).


Key Tasks:

* Data Cleaning:

    Handle missing values and outliers.
    Ensure correct data types for columns and fix any inconsistencies.

* Statistical Analysis:

    Compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
    Perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between features (e.g., how age or BMI correlates with the 
    likelihood of diabetes).

* Data Visualization:

    Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize distributions, 
    correlations, and key patterns in the data. Explore data by plotting the relationship between features and the
    target variable, Outcome (diabetes diagnosis).


Tools Used:

1. Python (with libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding environment


Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how to conduct EDA on a health-related dataset, focusing on understanding the relationships between various 
features and their correlation with diabetes. Insights gained from this analysis can guide further investigation or machine learning 
tasks for predicting diabetes.
