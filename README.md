Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Kaggle Dataset

Overview:
    This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, perform basic statistical analysis, and visualize key patterns using charts and graphs.

Dataset:
    *   Source: Kaggle (Diabetes dataset)
    *   The dataset contains data on (briefly describe what the 
        dataset is about, e.g., health, sales, customer data, etc.)

Key Tasks
1. Data Cleaning:

    Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
    Ensure correct data types for columns and fix any inconsistencies.

2. Statistical Analysis:
    Compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
    Perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between variables.

3. Data Visualization:
    Create histograms, box plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize distributions, correlations, and key patterns in the data.

Tools Used: 
    *   Python (with libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
    *   Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding environment

Conclusion:
    This project demonstrates how to conduct EDA on a health-related dataset, focusing on understanding the relationships between various features and their correlation with diabetes. Insights gained from this analysis can guide further investigation or machine learning tasks for predicting diabetes.

Setup:
    1. Clone the repo:
